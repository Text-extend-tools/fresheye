	* Rewrote interactive "interface" along the lines set by DK. Now there
	is a help summary and a 'default key' feature.
	* --resume has no argument anymore and it is off by default.
	* Fixed description of --context-size in fe's usage: no upper limit,
	must be 2 at least.
	* Word dictionary dump is sorted by the number of occurences, in
	descending order. No unique words in output. Properly handles empty
	files, as well as files having only one, or only two words in them.
	If all words are unique, the entire word dictionary is dumped.
	* Fixed building using Microsoft Developer Studio.
	* Updated win32/README with information on Cygwin
	* Merged win32/recode.dsw and win32/fe.dsw into win32/fe.dsw.
	* Changed version to 1.3.7.

2002-06-28  Vadim Penzin  <penzin@attglobal.net>

	* Added --without-cygwin to configure.in. Since Cygwin does not
	attempt to determine if debug version of Microsoft Runtime Library
	is present on the system, --without-cygwin disables --enable-debug
	and --enable-profile (which are meaningless in this context anyway).
	* Streamlined getopt_long detection logic and handling.
	* configure prints settings summary on exit.
	
2002-06-27  Vadim Penzin  <penzin@attglobal.net>

	* Added --enable-encoding to configure.in. src/fe.c, src/lingtbl.c and
	src/ui.c are not distributed anymore, configure creates these files from
	src/fe.koi8-r, src/lingtbl.koi8-r and src/ui.koi8-r.
	* Added platform detection at the build time.
	* Fixed src/Makefile.am for Cygwin's $EXEEXT, separated generated files
	from fe_SOURCES to nodist_fe_SOURCES and added them to MOSTLYCLEANFILES.
	Now building from CVS requires automake-1.5.
	* Changed default value of sensitivity threshold to 500.
	* fe --version and ce --version print information about the platform
	they were compiled on as well as default encoding which was set using
	--enable-encoding.
	* win32/*.dsp are broken for a while, will fix it later.
	
2002-06-27  Dmitry Kirsanov  <dmitry@kirsanov.com>

	* src/lingtbl.c: changed information values for yo
	* src/fe.c: broke infor() into two functions, infor_same() and
	infor_diff()
	* src/fe.c: in simwords(), added a step to decrease sim based on
	infor_diff()
	* src/fe.c: in set_count_coefficient() decreased divisor from 13 to 8
	to sharpen dependance on wordcount information
