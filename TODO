This file describes features that we would like to implement in the future,
in random order:

* Automatic generation of binary packages for various UNIX packaging systems
  (DEB, RPM etc).
* Installer for Win32.
* Unicode support, UTF-8 in particular.
* Implement '-O' option for changing encoding of output produced by
  Fresh Eye (Now it is #ifdef'ed out in src/ui.c).
* Use XML for the log file.
* Use GNU gettext for message translation and locale-aware functionality.
  (Can it be done on Win32?)
* Write a man page and/or texinfo documentation.
* Embedding API that would allow for integration of Fresh Eye into e-mail
  clients, text editors and word processors.
* More ports: Max OS X, HURD.

If you wish to participate, please contact 
Dmitry Kirsanov <dmitry@kirsanov.com> or Vadim Penzin <penzin@attglobal.net>
