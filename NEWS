This file describes changes made to Fresh Eye from one release to another.

* Fresh Eye 1.4

  Fresh Eye 1.4 features great performance and feature improvements over
  its predcessor - Fresh Eye 1.21, released in November 1995:

  - Fresh Eye 1.4 compiles and runs on a variety of platforms: Linux,
    FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Sun Solaris, Win32, and Cygwin. We believe that
    Fresh Eye can be compiled with no or little modifications on many
    other platforms.

  - Fresh Eye 1.4 supports virtually all major single-byte Russian
    encodings: KOI8-R, CP-1251, CP-866, MacCyrillics, ISO 8859-5.

  - Fresh Eye 1.4 imposes no artificial limitations on its input: length
    of a word, length of a line, number of lines in a file, size of the
    word dictionary, size of the context can be anything that fits in
    computer's memory.

  - Fresh Eye 1.4 is a true 32-bit application that is able to use all
    available memory found on modern desktop systems.

  - Fresh Eye undergone massive speed optimisations: now it processes
    its input up to ten times faster than Fresh Eye 1.21 on the same
    machine.
  
  - Fresh Eye 1.4 features a better command-line interface, which uses
    GNU long options, and is able to process several files at once.
  
  MS-DOS is not supported anymore. The state of OS/2 port made by
  K. Boyandin is unknown, link to his home page points nowhere.
  Fresh Eye 1.4 breaks compatibility with the log file format of
  Fresh Eye 1.21.
